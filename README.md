# Travelsphere

A simple website to find suitable transportation for your journey!

## Overview
This is mainly a mockup website for transportation provider company. We used [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for authenticate user for this project. You can select a suitable vehicle for you from four different categories - Bike, Car, Bus, Train. You can also select pick-up and destination point by this web-app. But before you able to get any of these facilitites, you have to create an account using your name, email and password or you can just register youself by using google. If you already are a user of this web-app, you just have to login by giving proper information. The map in the destination page, doesn't work perfectly, we're still working on that. 

## Technology Used

React â€¢ Firebase Auth
